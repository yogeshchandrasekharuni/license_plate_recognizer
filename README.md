# license_plate_recognizer

This project is a work-in-progress. When finished, it will be able to recognize the license-plate of a vehicle coming into a building through an in-gate, log it to a database and log it's out-time when it leaves through an out-gate. If you would like to contribute towards the development of this project, please create a pull-request.
