# license_plate_recognizer

This project is a work-in-progress. When finished, it will be able to recognize the license-plate of a vehicle coming into a building through an in-gate, log it to a database and log it's out-time when it leaves through an out-gate. If you would like to contribute towards the development of this project, please create a pull-request.


### Planned features

1. Extract License Plate Number (LPN).
2. Identify front / back of vehicle and determine if vehicle is entering / leaving the premises.
3. Log the LPN to a database.
4. Support external Red-Green light. Glows green if LPN has been logged successfully, glows red otherwise.
